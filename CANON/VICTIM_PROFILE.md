# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Sophie Williams
**Nickname/Handle:** @SophieSeeksAdventure
**Age:** 23
**Nationality:** British (Manchester)
**Occupation:** Gap year traveler, former retail worker

## Archetype
**Primary:** The Escapee

**Secondary traits:**
- Traveling specifically to get away from her ex
- Reinventing herself on the road
- Finally starting to feel free

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Hope (misdirected)

**How it manifests:**
- Believes she's successfully escaped her past
- Trusts that distance equals safety
- Underestimates how far obsession will travel
- Thinks a party crowd means protection

**How it kills them:**
Her belief that she's finally free blinds her to the danger that's been following her for weeks - until her ex appears in the crowd and it's too late.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'6", slim but healthy, tanned from weeks on the beach
- **Hair:** Dyed bright pink since leaving the UK - her "new identity" color
- **Distinguishing features:** Nose ring, multiple ear piercings, dozens of festival wristbands up both forearms
- **Typical outfit:** Bikini top, harem pants, bare feet on the beach, glitter on her cheekbones

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Optimistic - becomes denial about ongoing danger
2. Trusting - extends to believing her new friends can protect her

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Avoidant - ran from Dylan instead of involving authorities
2. Careless - posted her location constantly on social media

### Pet Peeves
- People who say travel isn't "real life"
- Being told what to do (reaction to controlling ex)
- Rain on beach days

### Fears
- Surface fear: Dylan finding her
- Deeper fear: That she can never truly escape, that she's marked forever

## Background

### Origin Story
Working class Manchester family, left school at 18, worked retail while dating Dylan for three years. The relationship turned controlling, then threatening. She saved secretly for two years to fund her escape. The day she booked her flight was the first time she felt hopeful in years.

### Why They Travel
Pure escape. Every mile between her and Manchester feels like healing. She's learning who she is without someone controlling her every move.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Following the Southeast Asia backpacker trail. Full moon party is a bucket list item - the ultimate symbol of freedom. This hostel on Koh Phangan is party central.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Buzzing," "Mint," "Proper," "Sound" (Northern English slang)
- Avoids words like: Dylan's name, anything about home
- Catchphrases: "Living my best life, me" / "This is what I needed"

### Speech Pattern
- Quick, energetic, Manchester accent
- Deflects serious topics with humor
- Gets quiet when the past comes up
- Laughs a lot, sometimes too much

### Internal Monologue Style
A mix of genuine joy and underlying anxiety. Always scanning for threats even while celebrating freedom. Reads like someone who can't quite believe they're allowed to be happy.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram
- **Follower count:** 1,400 (growing since she started posting travel content)
- **Posting style:** Beach sunsets, party videos, "I'm so free" captions, location tags on everything
- **Last post before death:** Full moon party setup with caption "Tonight's going to be LEGENDARY"

### Online vs Reality
Projects complete freedom; privately checks every photo for Dylan's face before posting. Still looks over her shoulder. Still has nightmares.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mum (Carol): Knows about Dylan, worried sick, daily texts
- Dad: Absent since childhood
- Younger sister (Emma): Sophie's main reason to stay alive - wants to be a good role model

### Friends
- Made a tight group in hostels - Aussie backpackers who adopted her
- They don't know about Dylan, only that she "needed a fresh start"

### Romantic
- Not ready, not looking, trying to remember how to be alone

### At the Hostel
- Part of a friend group heading to full moon party together
- Feeling safer in numbers for the first time in years

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up excited. Today's the day - full moon party. Paints her body with UV paint, adds more glitter, takes dozens of photos with new friends. Posts story: "Countdown to madness!"

### Their Last Normal Moment
Dancing on the beach as the sun sets, surrounded by friends, feeling genuinely free for the first time in three years. She doesn't see Dylan watching from the edge of the crowd.

### Final Thoughts
No. Not here. Not after everything. She came so far. She was finally happy. Emma's face. Mum's voice. The unfairness of it.

### Last Words
A choked attempt at a scream that no one hears over the music.

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Exits, escape routes (habit from living with Dylan), friendly faces, any man who looks like him
- They ignore: She's been posting her exact location for weeks; Dylan has been in Thailand for three days
- They judge: She doesn't - she's too busy being grateful for small freedoms

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [x] Introduction scene establishing archetype - arriving in Thailand, cutting off the last of her brown hair, going pink
- [x] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - tags exact hostel location in a post
- [x] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - phone call with sister Emma about the future
- [x] Warning ignored scene - thinks she sees Dylan in a crowd, tells herself she's paranoid
- [x] Point of no return - goes deeper into the party crowd to dance, separated from friends
- [x] The death
