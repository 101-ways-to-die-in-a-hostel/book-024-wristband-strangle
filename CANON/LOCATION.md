### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Haad Rin beach during the full moon party, approximately 200 meters from the main stage. The beach stretches for about 700 meters during the party, packed with 20,000-30,000 people. Sophie dies in the crowd, 50 meters from the water line, her body eventually found by the waterline where Dylan dragged her. The exact spot is indistinguishable from any other patch of sand - no marker, no memorial, just another point in the chaos.

## The City

**City:** Koh Phangan (Haad Rin area)
**Country:** Thailand
**Population:** ~15,000 permanent residents, swelling to 50,000+ during full moon week
**Known for:** Full moon parties, yoga retreats (north side), backpacker rite of passage

### Geography
- **Climate:** Tropical - hot and humid year-round, monsoon season Oct-Dec
- **Terrain:** Island - beaches, jungle-covered hills, limited roads
- **Weather during story:** High season (January) - hot, clear, perfect party weather

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Thai; English widely spoken in tourist areas
- **Religion(s):** Buddhist (Thai), with Hindu influences
- **Customs relevant to story:** Thai culture is gentle and non-confrontational, which can make tourists feel safer than they are; the economic dependence on full moon parties means issues get minimized

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Extremely High (bucket list destination)
- **Type of tourists:** Young backpackers, gap year travelers, party seekers, the occasional older traveler who didn't research
- **Danger level:** Moderate - generally safe but drugs, alcohol, and crowds create risk; sexual assaults and injuries common but underreported

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Hungover silence, waves, distant motorbikes
- Afternoon: Building anticipation, testing sound systems, tourist chatter
- Night (full moon): Overwhelming bass from multiple stages, screaming crowds, fire dancer drums, buckets clinking
- Unique sounds: The specific "Full Moon Anthem" that plays every hour

### Smells
- Hostel: Sunscreen, bug spray, stale beer, incense from reception
- Street: Fried food carts, motorbike exhaust, tropical flowers
- Beach during party: Sweat, alcohol, weed, smoke machines, saltwater, vomit

### Textures
- Surfaces: Splintery wood floors, sand everywhere, sticky bar surfaces
- Climate feel: Hot and humid, sweat never really dries

### Tastes
- Local food: Pad thai, mango sticky rice, coconut everything
- Party fare: Bucket cocktails (vodka, Red Bull, mysterious mixer), watermelon, street food satay

### Visual Details
- Colors: UV paint everything, neon signs, fire dancer flames, sunrise pinks
- Light quality: Dark beaches lit only by stages; strobing, disorienting
- Distinctive visuals: The full moon over the ocean, fire ropes spinning, painted bodies moving in ultraviolet

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Ploy
**Description:** 30s Thai woman, unflappable, has seen everything. Speaks excellent English, warns female guests to stick together.
**Role in death:** Gave Sophie the standard safety talk; later provides police with information about the British man asking questions.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Som | Works only before noon, avoids the chaos |
| Security | Lek | Young, more bouncer than security, handles drunk tourists |
| Bar | Various | Rotating backpacker staff working for free accommodation |
| Manager | John (British expat) | Owns 40%, hands-off, knows the darker side of the island |

### Staff Knowledge
They know the parties are dangerous - they clean up the aftermath. Ploy has helped women hide from following exes before. John knows people have died but the economy depends on the parties continuing.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe (Full Moon Week)
Recovery and preparation. Guests sleep until afternoon, rehydrate, nurse injuries and hangovers. UV paint and bucket cocktail prep begins around 5pm. Excitement builds.

### Night Vibe
Total chaos. Pre-gaming at the hostel bar, group walks to the beach, returning at sunrise covered in paint and sand. Many guests don't sleep at all during the main party night.

### Guest Demographics
18-30, predominantly. British, Australian, and German heavily represented. First-time international travelers, gap year kids, repeat full moon attendees. Very few solo female travelers - most pair up for safety.

### Reputation
"The place to be for full moon." "Cheap and cheerful." "Staff are helpful if you're in trouble." "Don't expect sleep." "Watch your stuff and your drink."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Ferry from Surat Thani or Koh Samui, then songthaew (shared taxi) to Haad Rin. During full moon week, ferries are packed and prices double.

### Check-in Process
Passport photocopy, payment in advance (cash preferred), safety briefing for first-timers, bucket cocktail coupons, invitation to pre-party at the hostel bar.

### Rules
- Keep valuables locked

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Full moon party details should be accurate - the location, atmosphere, crowd size, and chaos are well-documented. The reality of assaults and deaths at these events is underreported but real.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Thai culture and Buddhism should be treated respectfully
- The economic complexity of tourism dependency should be acknowledged
- Avoid "Thailand is dangerous" tropes - specific circumstances enable this crime
- Sex tourism exists on the island but isn't central to this story

### Sources
- Full moon party guides and firsthand accounts
- News reports on deaths and assaults at Koh Phangan parties
- Domestic violence statistics for victims killed by ex-partners
- Research on crowd dynamics and crime opportunity
